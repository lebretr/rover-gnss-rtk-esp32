# rover-gnss-rtk-esp32

ESP32-based RTK GNSS rover implementations with code examples, schematics, and documentation for high-precision positioning applications

Several of these implementations are derived from [jancelin / rover-gnss](https://github.com/jancelin/rover-gnss/blob/master/unit_tests/3b-GNSS_RTK/README.md). 
Thanks to [jancelin](https://github.com/jancelin) for sharing!
